Porting Microsoft Excel to C # /. Net platform
Spreadsheet WinForms component for .net desktop applications.

Often organisations have to work with xlsx documents, generate reports, read them, and existing solutions that based on Excel automation imposes restrictions. There is a need for a reliable good library and a component that will replace Excel and will be extensible, customisable, have great reliability, performance and maximum coverage of functionality and compatibility with Excel. It provides compatibility by file formats, by interface, hotkeys, dialogs, by the correctness and accuracy of calculations, by working with large amounts of data, by how the document is displayed on the screen and when printing, also provides a rich API with which you can modify the document and work with the control by tweaking it and redefining actions, doing what Excel couldn't do.

● Actively participated in product decisions and analytics
