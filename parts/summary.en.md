I’m a software engineer with 10 years experience with .net platform in a creating commercial components for business application developers in a global product company. 
I have been working on Rich Text Editor and Spreadsheet product for almost decade. We did tons of tricky algorithms, recreated MS Word and Excel in a .net platform with a love to reliability, quality, performance and attention to details.
Developed several web projects such as company sales platform, file conversion service, sales analytics dashboards.
_Carried out the stages of product development from idea_, requirements to shipping and maintaining product and was responsible for many parts of products. I like to share knowledge and be a mentor.
I’m familiar with various languages, tools, paradigms such as OOP, functional programming, and TDD. At the same time, I always try to find the best solution and choose the necessary instrument for a specific task.
By knowing several ecosystems (.Net, Node.js, JavaScript), I can find the best solution to complex problems. I can quickly get up to speed, learn new technologies, but at the same time I have sufficient experience and pragmatism to understand when existing solutions are more appropriate. I can work both autonomously and as a team member. I appreciate my work, I'm passionate about it, and I want my contribution to be valuable.
